#
# This file tells Git about engine files that never really belong in source control. They are usually build products, log
# files and intermediate files generated from a compiler or the engine runtime.
#
#
# NOTE:
# Paths that start with / match paths relative to the root (where the .gitignore file is)
# Paths that end with / will match a folder and all files under it (but not a regular file with no extension)
# Use * for wildcards. Wildcards stop at path separators
# Use ** for a wildcard that spans path separators
# Paths in this file should use forward slash characters, not back slashes
# Use \ to escape special characters like ! and #
# Use ! to negate a previous pattern. But it doesn't work if the parent sub-folder was masked out already.
#

# Ignore project files in the root
*.sln
*.xcodeproj

# Ignore VS 2017 project folder
.vs/

# Ignore local user Visual Studio files in any folder
*.suo
*.opensdf
*.sdf

# Ignore intermediate folders from Xcode
# TODO: This section can be removed after UnrealBuildTool has been changed to generated Xcode projects that force the 'build' directory to be created under the Intermediate folder instead.
