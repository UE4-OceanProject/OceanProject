*New features coming when they are ready* :p  - not currently working on it,  see below:


----------------------

Not currently able to do Dev work on this, you may have known I had to take a few months off last year, and it's happened again, this time even worse. It's hard to do Dev work laying in bed, wish I had a laptop that could run UE4... But I will all least try and help out those who want to try it, and/or make new contributions. 

Thanks all, the info below on regarding trello is not currently being monitored, but feel free to make a post here on github in the "issues" section temporarily. 

See you guys on the forums in the coming days!
